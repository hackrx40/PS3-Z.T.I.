#### Detailed Description of the solution​
This is a comprehensive stock suggestion model architecture that takes into account a variety of factors, including user data, stock preferences, risk profile, and news sentiment.​

## User data collection and preprocessing: 
The initial step is to gather information about the user, such as stock preferences, risk profiles, holdings, watchlists, and stock search trends. This data is then pre-processed in order to deal with missing data and resample the dataset.​

## Hierarchical clustering: 
The pre-processed data is then subjected to hierarchical clustering using agglomerative and divisive approaches. This will group stocks that are comparable.​

## Individual rank assignment:
Individual ranks are then awarded to the data depending on the outcomes of the collaborative and content-based filtering.​

## Hybrid filtering: 
The clustered data is then subjected to a hybrid filter that combines collaborative and content-based filtering. The filter combines item-based and user-based collaborative filtering for the part of collaborative filtering. The findings are then aggregated with random forest. The aggregated data is subsequently subjected to content-based screening. This filter leverages the user's stock search patterns to recommend equities that are similar to those they have previously searched for.​

## Ranks are being sorted: 
The rankings are then filtered to get a final list of suggested stocks.​

## Integration of the News API: 
A news API is used to receive current financial news. The news data is then pre-processed and sentimentally analysed.(Bing API used)​

## Analysis of Sentiment Intensity: 
A sentiment intensity analyzer is then used to analyse the sentiment of the news data for the currently selected equities. This will aid in determining whether the news is good, bad, or neutral.​

## Final stock recommendations: 
The final list of recommended stocks is generated by combining the stock suggestion model's outputs with the sentiment analysis of the news data.​
